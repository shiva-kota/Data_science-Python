ETL/ELT TESTING:
-trasformations mapping
-table relationships
-source-target testing

DATABASE TESTING:
-schema
-table
-attribute


DATA QUALITY COMPONENETS:
-Data profiling (metadata)
-Data quality analysis
    -validation
-Data cleasing
    -Matching
    -Eliminate errors, duplicates, inconsistencies
-Data quality monitoring
    -Reporying and monitoring


Data profiling
+Metadata Discovery
   -datatypes, length, precision, nullable
   -keywords
   -tags
   -relationships(Primary Key, Foreign Key)
+Descriptive methods
   -count
   -mean, max, min, distribution
+Validation levels
   -scheme, entity, attributes


DATA COMPLETENESS 
in this we check is there in null values are there .

DATA UNIQUENESS:
evvery data should be unique.

DATA VALIDITY:

Data PROFILING:

Metadat validations (count,datatype,length,precision,nullable)

*WHAT ARE DATABASE VIEWS?
database can contain several schemas, and within each database schema
can have different objects.

database tables which actually store data within a certain table.
which can have database reviews which don't store the data, but actually 
are stored queries that fetch data when you execute the view.

DATA QUALITY:
-data profiling
-data quality uniqueness
-data quality completeness
-data quality validity
-data quality consistency
-data quality integrity

DATA QUALITY CONSISTENCY:
